# 3D Silvaco Simulation of An SiC MOSFET

Programmed on Silvaco TCAD, this simulation aims to generate the datasheet values for an SiC Power MOSFET. Over the next few months, I will update this repository with techniques to 
transfer this simulation to Geant4 using CADMesh and conduct simulations to derive the MOSFET's Linear Energy Transfer (LET).
